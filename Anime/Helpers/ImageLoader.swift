/**
 Asynchronously downloads an image from a `URL`.
 
 Full disclosure: This code is adopted from https://www.vadimbulavin.com/asynchronous-swiftui-image-loading-from-url-with-combine-and-swift/
 
 I've written something similar for UIKit UIImages, but I hadn't done the same with SwiftUI until this exercise. I'm still learning SwiftUI, and after doing some research this seemed like the most elegant, SwiftUI'ish way to perform this functionality. Thus, like every developer ever, I shamelessly copied this from from a blog post (we all do this, StackOverflow anyone?). The above is a very good read, and expanded my knowledge of Combine and SwiftUI.
