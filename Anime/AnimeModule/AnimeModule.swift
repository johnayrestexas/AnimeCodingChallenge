     A production application would implement this functionality much differently. The `Module` object itself would be would be tracked, and the actual assemblage of said module would be handled by one or more classes that implement the Builder pattern, possibly employing one or more classes implementing the Abstract Factory and Factory Method patterns. I almost implemented a Builder for this exercise, but I felt like that would be over-engineering such a simple app.
