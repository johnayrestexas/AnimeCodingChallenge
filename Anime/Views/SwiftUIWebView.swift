/**
 This class provides the functionality to use WKWebView in a SwiftUI View.
 
 SwiftUI is still in its infancy and as of this writing it does not offer a SwiftUI version of everything found in UIKit. In order to display web pages in a SwiftUI application, we must create a wrapper around WKWebView. This is a very minimal wrapper providing only the most basic functionality of WKWebView. In an actual production application, this would be a complete implementation, but for this example application such functionality was unnecessary.
