# AnimeCodingChallenge
This is a coding challenge I did for a company a few years ago. It's a simple example of calling a RESTful API and displaying some data. The most interesting part of this exercise was the implementation of a simple VIPER style architecture, which means this tiny application is a little over-engineered for what it does, but could be easily built out into a much larger application with a lot more functionality.

This makes use of the Jikan API v4.0 (https://docs.api.jikan.moe/), a free, open source, unofficial MyAnimeList API (although not affiliated with MyAnimeList.net).
